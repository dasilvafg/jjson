JJSON [package org.json]
===============================

This project is a clone of the [JSON-java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) project with only
one modification.

The `JSONObject` class is changed to use `LinkedHashMap` instead of `HashMap`
to preserve the order of insertion of the attributes.

All other features, including package names, are preserved.

For more information, please [consult the original project](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java).
